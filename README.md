### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://madroosterlab.github.io/FEM-BlogCard](https://madroosterlab.github.io/FEM-BlogCard)

## My process

Code, pray, test, repeat...

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I'm scraping off some rust from my HTML & CSS skills. This challenge was easy but took me a lot of time. I hope to continue to build up my skills from here. This is the first page I've coded in several years. Yikes!

### Continued development

I would love to make this page completely responsive. I need to study and review a lot of notes before I can attempt that. I would also like to use semantic HTML, less ID's, and no negative margins. I only did that once!
